Create a full-featured multi-user Swiss private banking web application (exactly like Julius Baer / Pictet / Lombard Odier) using Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion and lucide-react icons.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR 100% VERCEL + REPLIT COMPATIBILITY:
- Must deploy on Vercel with ZERO errors (no 404, no hydration, no env issues)
- NO backend, NO database — all users and data stored in lib/users-data.ts as a simple object
- Server Components by default, "use client" only where needed
- No app/api routes
- middleware.ts protects all routes except / and /login
- Static generation where possible

MULTI-USER SYSTEM (this is the most important part):
- Users are stored in lib/users-data.ts as a const object:
  Example structure:
  {
    "alexander.weber": { password: "123456", name: "Alexander Weber", accounts: [...] },
    "marina.berger": { password: "secret2025", name: "Marina Berger", ... },
    // I will add more users myself later
  }
- After login with correct login+password → session stored in cookies (next-iron-session or cookies())
- Each user has exactly 3 accounts in CHF:
  1. Private Account (main spending)
  2. Savings Account (with 2.15% interest label)
  3. Investment Portfolio
- Each account has: name, type, IBAN (valid Swiss format CH...), balance (you set realistic different amounts per user), currency: "CHF"
- I must be able to easily change balances and add new users just by editing users-data.ts

CORE FEATURES AFTER LOGIN:

1. /dashboard
   - Luxury dark/light mode (dark by default), toggle in header
   - Greeting: "Good morning, Mr. Alexander Weber"
   - Total wealth across all accounts in CHF
   - Three beautiful glassmorphism cards with:
     • Account name + type
     • Swiss IBAN
     • Current balance (big typography)
     • Small mock sparkline chart
     • "Transfer" button → opens transfer modal

2. Transfer modal (SEPA & International)
   - Select source account
   - Input recipient IBAN (with Swiss/EU format validation)
   - Recipient name (optional)
   - Amount in CHF
   - Reference
   - Show fee (e.g. CHF 0 internal, CHF 12 external)
   - On submit:
     • If recipient IBAN belongs to another user in the system → money moves instantly to that user's account
     • Otherwise → shown as outgoing external transfer
     • Balance updates immediately
     • Success animation + confetti (subtle)

3. /transactions
   - All transactions of current user across all accounts
   - Filter by account and date
   - Beautiful list with +/−, counterparty name (resolved if internal), IBAN, date

4. /accounts — detailed view of each account with full history

5. Login page /login
   - Two fields: Login (e.g. alexander.weber) + Password
   - Beautiful Swiss luxury design with gradient background
   - On success → redirect to /dashboard

6. Landing page /
   - Minimalist Swiss private banking homepage
   - Big "Client Login" button → /login

Additional requirements:
- Use real valid Swiss IBANs (CH93 0000 ... format)
- All balances and users easily editable in one file (lib/users-data.ts)
- Include at least 5 different users with different balances (from CHF 250,000 to CHF 8,500,000)
- 30+ realistic transactions per user (salaries, dividends, transfers, bills, etc.)
- Fully responsive (mobile = like Pictet or UBS app)
- Custom 404 page in Swiss style
- Logout button

Output:
Give me the COMPLETE project with exact folder structure and full content of EVERY file including:
- lib/users-data.ts with 5+ users and editable balances
- middleware.ts
- package.json (exact working dependencies)
- tsconfig.json, next.config.mjs, tailwind.config.ts
- All pages and components
- README.md with "How to add new user" instructions

After I paste your code into a fresh Replit Next.js project → Run → Deploy to Vercel → everything must work instantly.
Make it look extremely expensive, discreet, and 100% like a real Swiss private bank.
